# BetterCommandTest

This is a bot I made to test a command handler.

# Usage

As always, this bot is hosted on Repl.it so you might want to follow [the idiot's guide](https://anidiots.guide/hosting/repl)

Clone this repo while making a repl

Make sure you have these lines in your `.env` file:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token goes here>
```

You can modify your prefix in the `settings.json` file
